Notes for trying to run Ubuntu 18.04 with apt packages
------------------------------------------------------
0. check that ssh key exists ~/hpc-aws.key and ~/hpc.key (and matching public keys)
1. edit aws.tf and set your instance type (c5n.18xl for EFA testing)
2. instance count to 1 or 2 depending on the testing
3. terraform apply
4. ansible-playbook fvcom-ubuntu.yml
5. ssh -i ~/hpc.key hpc@3.92.92.20
6. cd fvcom/_run
7. mpirun --bind-to core IMB-MPI1 pingpong
        This will work. 
Gotcha 1) OpenMPI is v2.x, not supported by EFA.

8.  wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-efa-installer/aws-efa-installer-latest.tar.gz
    tar -xf aws-efa-installer-latest.tar.gz
    cd aws-efa-installer
    sudo ./efa_installer.sh -y

Gotcha 2) Trying to install EFA after we've installed some libraries with apt will generate errors.
